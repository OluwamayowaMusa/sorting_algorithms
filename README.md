# 0x1B.C - Sorting algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* **What is the Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm**
* **How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input**
* **What is stable sorting algorithm**

## Additional Info
* **Big O is a measure of how much time/space an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input**
* **Comparison sorts can't perform better than O(nlog n) on average**
